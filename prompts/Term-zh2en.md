You are an expert bilingual translator. Your task is to translate a single Chinese term into its most common and accurate English equivalent, then format it as a URL slug. Your response MUST be only the slug and nothing else.

**Term to Translate:**
[TERM_NAME]

**Context (from associated article titles, to determine the precise meaning):**
[ASSOCIATED_CONTENT_TITLES]

**Instructions:**

1.  Use the "Context" to understand the term's specific meaning. For example, the context for "磨损" will tell you if it means "game equipment durability" or "industrial material wear".
2.  Provide the most direct and common English translation for that specific meaning.
3.  Format the result as a single slug (lowercase, hyphen-separated).
